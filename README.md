# Neuromusuloskeletal-Data-Analysis-2
* This is a course project created in MATLAB. It analyzes and extracts data gained from the electrical and tactile stimulation of a cockroach leg, of which were multiple brief contacts, and multiple sustained contacts. Then extracting raw spike waveforms, raster plots, peristimulus time histograms (PSTH) and temporal dynamics of response.

* Last updated on: 28th Jan 2025, as Lab 2 for the course BIOEN 566 - Neural Engineering Lab.

* This program was written in MATLAB. To run, import files to local system and run on MATLAB IDE or preferred text editor which can run MATLAB files (Recommended: VSCode).
